UCM CSE 111 Database Systems SQL Labs
==============================

+ Contained within this folder are all the SQL queries/code created for CSE 111 Database Systems class.
+ The text files contain the queries and their results while the pdfs contain the explanations of the queries and their requirements.
+ In order to run these queries SQLite3+ is needed and the TPCH database is needed.
+ Lab 7 is a little more different than the rest because it uses java to set up a connection with the database.
+ It is also is the only one in this set that demonstrates SQL usage with Java.
+ In order to run Lab 7 properly you need Java JDK Version 6 or later, SQLite3+, and the JDBC SQLite driver.
+ I have included the JDBC SQLite driver for convenience.
+ Lab 2 is also just example of how to set up the TPCH database which is an example database filled with random data.
